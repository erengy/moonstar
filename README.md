# Moonstar #

This project intends to revive one of the most popular Turkish software ever written, namely "MoonStar Türkçe Dil Kılavuzu", otherwise known as "MTU Sözlük".

MoonStar was an easy-to-use application that included Turkish-English, English-Turkish and Turkish synonyms dictionaries, a spell checker, and a Hangman game. However, being a 16-bit application programmed in 1994, it's not possible to run it under a 64-bit OS without using some kind of emulation.

Driven by curiosity, this project sets out to provide a free, open source, multi-platform interface to MoonStar.

**Roadmap:**

- Reverse engineer remaining dictionaries
- Write an extractor for each file
- Build a GUI that emulates the original application
